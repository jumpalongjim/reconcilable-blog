Fundamentally, the issue is to do with sovereignty.

Sovereignty is something important and valued. We value it at a very high cost in fact, not just for ourselves but for
other countries for themselves.

For example, if one country decides to take control of another, we might use force to prevent them. When other countries
in the past have wanted to take sovereignty over England, we have paid with the lives of our people and the prime resources
of our country to stop them. Sovereignty is not something that should be given up because of a few billion pounds
either way or a few jobs here or there. We should value it even at the cost of millions of lives, just as previous
generations have done.

Helpless to act because members can't agree. The response is frequently late and acrimonious. There is generally a
failure to reach European solutions.

Examples are mis-managing the debts in Greece, and mis-managing the influx of migrants from the middle east.

The responses they end up making are inconsistent compromises that break with the principles and agreements made by treaty.

The root of the problem is that they expect and legislate to act as a single nation, but individual nations retain their 
own policies. The problems are structural.

Major policies that were said to be central to the EU are simply cast aside such as the Schengen border treaty and the
common currency principles.

The majority of Europe (with power or money) turn on the weaker and unfortunate members such as Greece (suffering from
currency results and on the border at the edge of Europe) and enforce nasty and unfair decisions.

Schengen was never thought through properly, leaving Europe's difficult border controls the responsibility of the poorest
countries, the soft under-belly.


Bernard Ingham: Daily Telegraph 27th Jan
The European Union is corrupt, useless and riddled with fraud, Sir Bernard Ingham has said.
He said: "Europhiles might usefully address themselves not to the question why we should stay in the EU, but why we should ever want to be a member of it at all when the institution is corrupt and so riddled with fraud that the auditors have felt unable to sign off its accounts for nigh on 20 years.
"It is dedicated to exactly what we do not want - ever closer union. It has already wrecked much of Europe's economy, though not the UK's, with its single currency, and has generated politically dangerous levels of unemployment in its southern states."
Sir Bernard also said the EU was useless when it came to international action and pretended to have a foreign service.
"The present EU model is a discredited mess and everyone knows we cannot go on like this", he said.
Accusing the EU of amassing powers at the expense of the member states, he warned of the damaging consequences for Western democracy.
He said: "What is so frightening about standing on our own two feet in a developing world, trading with whom we like? What are our tycoons afraid of?
"What is so alarming about the British Government, monitored by the Westminster Parliament, recovering its power to govern the British people?"
