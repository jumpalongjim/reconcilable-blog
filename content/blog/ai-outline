Computer programs can always beat people at chess
- programs are being developed to accomplish increasingly 'intelligent' tasks
- natural human intelligence far outstrips any program 'in general' because we can learn and create new ideas in very general ways. In other words, we can turn our intelligence to and endless range of tasks and devise new plans and strategies.
- it might be posssible to write programs that also can learn and adapt themselves to increased understanding, leading to a more general intelligence capability somewhat comparable to a human mind. (This does not necessarily mean that the MI is conscious or thinks in the same way that we do, just that it can assimilate new information, discover ways to strategise and make use of what it has learnt in ways that were not predicted by the original software engineers.)
Consider the eventual introduction of an MI that has comparable general intelligence capability to the best human minds.
- Its level of intelligence will continue to improve by several mechanisms, including continued R&D,
