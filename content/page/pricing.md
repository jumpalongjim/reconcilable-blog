## How does the 14-day free trial work?

Choose your plan and try it for 14 days. If you cancel before the first month is up, you won't be charged a thing.

We will email you during your free trial to check everything is going well and, in particular, **we'll remind you a week before the trial is up in case you want to cancel.** You can opt out of these emails if you wish.

On the other hand, if you love Reconcilable then just keep on using it. Your account will be renewed automatically each month by billing you one month at a time.

## Transparent Pricing

There are no setup or usage fees other than the single monthly charge shown above. Reconcilable is a pay-as-you-go service with no long term contract. You can cancel, upgrade or downgrade your account at any time via your account page. When changing your subscription plan, new pricing will apply from you next billing date. If you cancel then you will not receive any more charges.

## Support Included

Knowledgeable and friendly support is available on all subscriptions, including during the free trial period. We do our best to answer all emails within 24 hours.
