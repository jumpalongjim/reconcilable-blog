# Reconcilable is simple reconciliation software that will save you time

Reconcile faster and with less effort for a smoother close process.

Improve control over your accounts.

Solve your difficult and time-consuming reconciliation challenges.

### Import your data from Excel

Load data to a reconciliation by copy-pasting or drag and dropping from a file or directly from within Excel.

### Define rules to automate matching

Rules are used for finding matching records within your data. They compare text, dates and numbers to your specification so you get exactly the results you want.

### Inspect and edit

Take a look at the state of your reconciliation and inspect which records have been matched together and which are outstanding. Put together unusual or difficult matches by hand so that the final results are perfect.

### Report and export back to Excel

Create reports directly, or simply export back to Excel for further reporting and analysis.

### Reuse and repeat

Add more data to a reconciliation or simply repeat it with new data entirely. Once the configuration is set during the first run you can reuse it as much as you like without any further effort.

### Keep track of each financial close

When working on a periodic reconciliation you can define periods in Reconcilable and then track what happened in each period separately. Periods are also used to close off completed work so that it is locked from further changes.

### Use as many reconciliations as you need

Need a new rec for a new control point or simply as a one-off analysis? In Reconcilable you can create as many reconciliations as you need, each one containing its own configuration and data.
